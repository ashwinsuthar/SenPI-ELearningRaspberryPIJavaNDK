With SenPi installed on your smartphone you can easily control your computer or tablet via WiFi. For example by using the touchpad of your phone you can open the internet browser and navigate to the pages you want to visit. Furthermore it gives you the opportunity to use the music player or your media center without being next to your pc or laptop. Summarizing SenPi allows you to do almost everything you would be able to do with a mouse and a keyboard but also from a greater distance. Even powering on the computer via WLAN is supported by this app.
To make these replacements possible SenPi offers you a touchpad, a keyboard, multimedia keys and buttons for starting applications. <br/>
The fresh design makes SenPi an eye-catcher. Moreover several color designs for the user interface are available to adapt it to your individual flavor. Automatically switching from portrait to landscape mode is another feature making it perfectly fitting for the user in every situation.
<br/>
For using the app you need to
- download and install the app on your phone and
- download and install the SenPi-Server you can easily get on http://qremote.org on the item (computer, tablet, raspberry pi) you like to control!  (By now the QRemote-Server application is available for Windows, Linux and Mac.) <br/>
